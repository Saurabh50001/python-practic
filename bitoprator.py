# and bit oprator example
x=10
y=8

# binary no of 10/x
print(bin(x)) # binary of 10 is 1010
print(bin(y)) # binary of 8 is 1000
print(x&y,bin(x&y)) #binary of x&y is 1000

# # or bit opratior example
# print(bin(x)) # binary of 10 is 1010
# print(bin(y)) # binary of 8 is 1000
# print(x|y,bin(x|y)) #binary of x|y is 1010

# # xor bit opratior example
# print(bin(x)) # binary of 10 is 1010
# print(bin(y)) # binary of 8 is 1000
# print(x^y,bin(x^y)) #binary of x^y is 10
